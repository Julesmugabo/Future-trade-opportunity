 Trade Data Growth Prediction Dashboard

This project is an app done in streamlit to  analyzing trade performance and predicting future growth across **countries and commodities**.  
It combines historical trade data with regression-based predictions to identify top **investment or export opportunities**.

It provides **interactive necessary visualization and insights** all to help you understand the dataset
It contains also machine learning graphs got from computed models that predict our goal.

The following are steps we took in preparing it
1. loaded and merged data
2. we also did feature engineering
3. we trained our model and tested it
4. we also provided the visualisations of the predictions.

This app can be run when you install the dependencies 
like in your terminal 
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn openpyxl

Thank you.
